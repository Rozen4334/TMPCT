### 🎆 Terraria Multiplayer Chat Translator

TMPCT is a no-dependency console application for all platforms that can, on launch, translate incoming multiplayer Terraria chat messages to your preferred language, and translate outgoing chat messages to the preferred outgoing language. This is an attempt to close the gap between english and non-english speaking servers, ultimately allowing everyone to play together!

### ❓Does this application modify the client?

No! It is click and play. The application does not involve any form of client modification, as it sniffs the established connection to the internet instead of the game itself to modify chat content. Feel free to browse the source code if you have any questions about the approach!
